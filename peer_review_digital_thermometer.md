# Peer Review Report: Digital Thermometer (Python Program)

**Reviewer:** Abdirahman Hashim 674353 

## 1. Overview
The **Digital Thermometer** program is a simple Python-based application that converts a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit and provides qualitative feedback on the weather condition. The project uses a user-input-based approach, applying a mathematical conversion formula within a function to demonstrate basic programming logic, conditional statements, and user interaction.

This implementation serves as a foundational example of how programming can simulate real-world sensor-based systems in a software-only environment.

## 2. Strengths
- **Code Clarity:** The program is concise and easy to read, making it suitable for beginners learning Python.  
- **Functional Decomposition:** The use of a dedicated function `celsius_to_fahrenheit()` demonstrates good programming structure and modularity.  
- **User Interaction:** The inclusion of personalized feedback messages (“hot day,” “cold day,” “moderate weather”) enhances usability and user engagement.  
- **Mathematical Accuracy:** The conversion formula `(C × 9/5) + 32` is correctly implemented, producing accurate results.  
- **Output Formatting:** The Fahrenheit value is rounded to two decimal places, improving output presentation.

## 3. Areas for Improvement
- **Main Function Invocation:** The conditional statement at the end uses `"_main_"` instead of `"__main__"`. This typo prevents the main function from executing automatically when the script runs.  
- **Input Validation:** The program does not currently handle invalid inputs (e.g., letters or special characters). Implementing error handling using `try-except` blocks would improve reliability.  
- **Code Documentation:** The script lacks comments describing each function and logic block, which would help readers understand the purpose of each section.  
- **Scalability:** The current program could be expanded to include additional temperature units (e.g., Kelvin) or live data inputs from a sensor for practical use.

## 4. Suggestions for Enhancement
- **Fix the Execution Condition:** Replace `if __name__ == "_main_":` with `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure proper program execution.  
- **Add Error Handling:**
  ```python
  try:
      celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in degrees Celsius: "))
  except ValueError:
      print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
      return
